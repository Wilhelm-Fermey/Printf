# Ft_Printf

## Description

The task of the 'ft_printf' project from the 42 School was, to recode the behaviour of the original printf function. The printf function copies a string of character to the stdout. The string can include format specifiers, which start with a % character, which indicate the method to translate a piece of data (such as a number) to characters.
